## Course Project

As part of this course, a project was undertaken involving the preparation and processing of data collected from the Department of Finance. The project encompassed the following tasks:

- Transfer rates by commodity and holding
- Statistical analysis of the highest and lowest transfers in each organization by product
- Examination of the transfer of goods, comparing their number and value with the deputy and holding company and operators
- Analysis of the most frequently transported goods by division of deputy, holding, and operators
- Calculation of association relations

The codes and materials related to this project are available within this repository, allowing for in-depth exploration and understanding of the project's components and outcomes.
